# üå≥ Decision Tree Implementation from Scratch (with Pruning)
Welcome to this notebook where we implement a **Decision Tree classifier** from scratch using Python. This notebook covers everything from dataset loading and entropy calculations to building and pruning the tree.

---

## üìå Objectives
- Understand the fundamentals of Decision Trees
- Implement Decision Tree algorithms using core Python
- Visualize decision boundaries
- Apply **pre-pruning and post-pruning** techniques to avoid overfitting
- Evaluate model performance

---

## üìÇ Notebook Structure
1. **Import Libraries**  
   Load necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   Load and inspect the dataset used for classification (e.g., Iris or custom CSV).

3. **Entropy & Information Gain**  
   Define functions to calculate entropy and information gain ‚Äî the core of decision tree splitting.

4. **Build the Tree**  
   Recursively split data using the best features to form a decision tree.

5. **Tree Visualization**  
   Plot or print the tree structure for better understanding.

6. **Prediction Function**  
   Implement a function to predict output for new data samples.

7. **Accuracy and Evaluation**  
   Evaluate accuracy on train/test split or k-fold cross-validation.

8. **‚ú® Pruning Techniques**
   - **Pre-pruning**: Avoid deep splits when improvement is minimal.
   - **Post-pruning**: Prune the fully-grown tree using a validation set to reduce overfitting.
